            <h2>E-Commerce Application</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>

            <h3>Backend</h3>
            <p>
              Node server written with Express. Prisma ORM interfaces with a
              PostgreSQL database storing products, users, user sessions, and
              user carts. Express-session and Passport.js manage user sessions
              and authentication. Testing Unit and integration tests are written
              with Jest. SuperTest is used for requests. The database is cleared
              before each test or between test suites depending on test
              requirements. Two Prisma schema files correspond to a "public"
              schema for development and a "test" schema for testing. Running
              "dev-init" or "test-init" will reset the given database and
              prepare for development or testing.
            </p>
            <h3>Frontend</h3>
            <p>
              React application using React Router and Styled Components. Allows
              a user to view a feed of products. A user can sign in or register
              to add products to their cart. Product quantity can be updated
              from the cart page. User profile details can be updated from the
              profile page.
            </p>
            <h3>To Do</h3>
            <p>
              Checkout functionality, view prior orders, Admin gui
              functionality, third party login
            </p>

            <h2>Angular E-Commerce Application</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              A rewrite of the E-Commerce Application frontend using TypeScript
              and Angular. This application shares the Node server and
              PostgreSQL database made for E-Commerce Application.
