            <h1>E-Commerce Application</h1>

            <a>Coming soon, a link to the app</a>
            <h2>Backend</h2>
            <p>
              Prisma ORM interfaces with a PostgreSQL database storing products,
              users, user sessions, and user carts. Express-session and
              Passport.js manage user sessions and authentication. Testing Unit
              and integration tests are written with Jest. SuperTest is used for
              requests. The database is cleared before each test or between test
              suites depending on test requirements. Two Prisma schema files
              correspond to a "public" schema for development and a "test"
              schema for testing. Running "dev-init" or "test-init" will reset
              the given database and prepare for development or testing.
            </p>
            <h2>Frontend</h2>
            <p>

              to view a feed of products. A user can sign in or register to add
              products to their cart. Product quantity can be updated from the
              cart page. User profile details can be updated from the profile
              page.
